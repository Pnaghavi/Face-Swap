# Face-Swap
Swapping face landmarks using Google face API
The original App was called how you look bald which made since I made the app for myself and whomever I was taking a picture with, but in essence the App swaps major face landmarks using the Google face API. This app allows the user and a friend take a photo togeter then once they shake the phone it will swap their faces. There is also a vibrate button that is a fragment that shakes the phone.
